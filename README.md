Hi, I’m Unique Shrestha, an SEO Specialist focused on helping individuals and businesses improve their online visibility, strengthen their search rankings, and grow consistently through organic search. My core expertise includes on-page SEO, technical SEO, keyword research, backlink audits, content optimization, competitor analysis, and SEO performance tracking. I enjoy using data-driven strategies to understand search intent, identify ranking gaps, and optimize content and websites for long-term results.

Along with SEO, I also have secondary skills in web development, which support my ability to perform more technical audits and implement SEO-friendly structures. I have intermediate experience in HTML, CSS with Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, PHP, Node.js, and Express. These development skills help me understand how websites are built from the ground up, enabling me to optimize technical elements such as routing, metadata, site structure, speed, and crawlability more effectively.

On my GitHub, you will find SEO-related projects, web development practice repositories, backend experiments, and tools I build while learning new optimization techniques. I’m passionate about improving search performance, analyzing technical issues, and creating clean, search-friendly digital experiences.
